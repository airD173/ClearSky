# ClearSky
ClearSky is a Discord bot that shows weather information using the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). It gets the users location from an inputted ZIP code using a ZIP code database provided by https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/.
# Usage
To use the bot, create a new Discord application from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developersc) and create a new bot. Copy the token. Then, create a new file called `.env`. In this file, add your token using the following syntax: `TOKEN=yourtokenhere`. 
# To do
- Reduce the amount of different .py files by merging some of them into single .py files
- Add build section to readme
  - ~~Add requirements.txt~~
- Add images to readme
